# write-up
for my thesis writing. i'm writing initially in `markdown` before formatting into `tex`. 

## layout
- `figs/` contains figures
- `writing/` contains the `markdown` documents 
- `pdf/` contains `tex` files and compiled PDFs

## comments
comment format:
```markdown
## heading
my text
> your comment
```
which looks like:

-----------------

## heading
my text

> your comment

-----------------
